PROGRAM
----------------------

This program provides an interface to standard matrix operations and algorithms, which include row/column operations, transposition, inversion, multiplication, gaussian elimination and, in particular, simplex method (using only standard form).

Methods GaussianElimination and Invert are not tested due to absence of Determinant function. Simplex method examples are only fully verified by hand.

----------------------
USAGE
----------------------

To compile the program, run:

    cmake .
    make

Followed by:

    ./_matrix ./src/tests/... ; echo $? # some file

The supporting program for generating examples is matrix_gen.pl, which generates matrices of given width and height.

TESTING
----------------------

To run google-tests, run:

    ./_testmatrix
