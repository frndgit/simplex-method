## Program

This program provides an interface to standard matrix operations and algorithms, which include row/column operations, transposition, inversion, multiplication (and so on) and, in particular, simplex method (using the standard form).

Method `GaussianElimination` is not yet properly tested and `SimplexMethod` is only validated by hand.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use:

    cmake .
    make

## Testing

To run google-tests, execute:

    ./_testmatrix
    ./_simplex ./test/tests/... ; echo $? # some file

The supporting program for generating examples is **matrix_gen.pl**, which prints matrices of given width and height.
